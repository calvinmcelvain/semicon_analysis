3. `_03_paneltests.do`: Conducts various panel data tests including VIFs, autocorrelation, heteroscedasticity, and unit root tests.
4. `_04_estimation.do`: Runs different econometric models to estimate the impact of protectionist policies.
5. `_05_robustchecks.do`: Performs robustness checks including placebo tests, COVID-19 impact analysis, and sensitivity analysis.
6. `plots.R`: Generates various plots to visualize the results of the analysis.
